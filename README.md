This repository contains my work on Logistic Regression applied to two popular datasets: the Iris dataset and the Titanic dataset.
The goal is to understand the performance of Logistic Regression for classification tasks and compare results across different datasets.

Datasets Used
Iris Dataset - A classic dataset containing 150 samples of iris flowers classified into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
Titanic Dataset - A dataset containing passenger information from the Titanic disaster, used to predict survival based on features like age, fare, and class.

Results and Insights
The Iris dataset demonstrates how Logistic Regression can handle multi-class classification.
The Titanic dataset highlights how Logistic Regression can be applied to real-world binary classification problems.
Performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
